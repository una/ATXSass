For the first-ever ATXSass meetup, we'll start simple: with an overview. I'll walk you through the most common Sass features and explain why preprocessors are valuable to the pure CSS fan. I'll touch briefly on some of the various ways to install and use Sass, and give some tips on starting a new project with Sassâ€”or refactoring your CSS to Sass, my personal favorite topic. Come learn how to use Sass as an authoring tool to help you write maintainable, modular, and way Sassier CSS. (p.s. If you know me, you won't be surprised, but there will be GIFs, there will!)
