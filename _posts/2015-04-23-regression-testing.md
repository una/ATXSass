You've spent months perfecting your layout; lining up pixels and matching up line-heights. You're almost ready to launch when a request comes in to redesign a major component. You shudder in fear at the thought of having to manually regression test every page of the site to make sure you didn't break anything.

Wouldn't it be nice if there were an automated way to run a visual regression test? A way to warn you if changes break the UI in unexpected ways? These tools exist, and building them in to your workflow isn't impossible.

In this session, you'll learn: 
- What tools are available and where do they each excel 
- How to get started with Gemini 
- How you can avoid the pitfalls of visual regression testing
